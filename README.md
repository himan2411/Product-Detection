Product recognition and detection from shelf images

This approach of ibject detection is inspired from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01733.pdf on product recognition on store shelves.

And the data used here is [Toward Retail Product Recognition on Grocery Shelves](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/280e/57ea3e882f82a60065fedde058ce00769c06.pdf).
